# Adaptive-traffic-signal

This project aims to tackle urban traffic congestion through a real-time system for traffic density calculation and signal estimation at intersections. Utilizing image process- ing and object detection algorithms, the system categorizes vehicles from CCTV footage to accurately determine traffic density. Moreover, it incorporates a dynamic signal esti- mation algorithm that adjusts signal timings based on real-time traffic density, optimizing lane allocation and congestion reduction. The system is complemented by a simulation model, integrating advanced technologies such as machine learning. Experimental re- sults validate its efficacy in improving traffic flow and mitigating congestion, providing a scalable solution for urban mobility challenges.
